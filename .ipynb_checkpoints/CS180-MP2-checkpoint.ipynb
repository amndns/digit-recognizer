    "Handwritten character recognition is the ability of a device to process input handwritten characters taken from printed physical documents or handwritten characters written from a touchscreen. The input handwritten digits are usually in the form of an image or a real-time recognition using a camera for optical scanning. The input is then fed to a pattern-recognition software for the recognition process. This technology is often used to extract characters from old printed documents for those documents to have a soft copy. In addition, handwritten character recognition is also used to recognize handwritten characters written from a touchscreen."

    "In this paper, we deal with a subset of handwritten characters which are handwritten digits. A database of handwritten digits, called MNIST database, is used to train and test a machine learning model for handwritten character recognition. In particular, the MNIST database is used in this paper to feed the feedforward neural network for training and testing. Furthermore, according to Yann LeCun, the MNIST database currently contains $60,000$ images for training and $10,000$ images for testing. The set of images in the MNIST database is the combination of two NIST databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 2 which are gathered from American high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau."

An MNIST image, with $28x28$ pixel size, is flattened into a vector of $784$ pixels, where each pixel value has the range of $[0, 255]$, with $0$ being the hex color of $0x00$ and $255$ being the hex color of $0xFF$.

    "The feedforward neural network (ANN) contains an input layer, $XX$ hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has $784$ nodes, where each of the nodes corresponds to the pixel of an image. Preferably, the number of nodes in the hidden layer is between the number of nodes in the input layer and the number of nodes in the output layer. In our case, we chose an arbitrary number of $XX$ nodes for the hidden layer. Lastly, the output layer contains $10$ nodes corresponding to the one-hot vector format. The graph of the feedforward neural network is shown in the figure below. <h4> ##Ryan, create a drawing of our neural network## </h4>"

The details and implementation of the training will be further discussed in the following sections."

Moreover, we chose $3$ hidden layers each with $500$ neurons. Lastly, the maximum number of epochs or iterations for training was set to $100$. The number of epochs of $100$ was chosen so that the ANN converges to a near-zero error rate while not prolonging the training time.
